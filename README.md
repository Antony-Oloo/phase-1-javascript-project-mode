DISCOUNT/COUPON APPLICATION
Introduction: 
I have always wanted to come up with a discount application as the area of discounts, offers, and coupon has been an area I have had so much interest in for a better part of my life as a young man. In this first project I would like to build a simple MVP that I will be able to dive into in the future and come up with my dream app finally that can be available in the market. I am also glad that this was a recommendation from you too. 

 Overview
My project will be on a discount/ Coupon Application. My plan is to act as a middleman between businesses and Customers. In my app I would like both the brands and customers to benefit. Brands can be able to use the app as a marketing platform while users will be able to browse through discounts from various brands and find deals that most interests them. 
where you log on to the project you will be able to view different coupons that are availlable for different brands. when get coupon is clicked then a QR code and a secret security code is generated. 

Core Features of the MVP:
1.	Ability to display a list of available discounts. This should be fetched from a db.json file. 
2.	Users can be able to click on discounts to view more details about the discount. 
3.	Be able to implement features such as the search function that will help users to find the available discounts from different brands. 
4.	Implement a search/filter function to help users find discounts by brand or category.
5.	Availability of a form for the brands to enter available discounts. 

API or Data Used: 
The project has  used a local db. json file to simulate the backend. This will handle all the data from brands (discount data). The data can include things like the name of the brand, the exact discount offered, expiration date of the discount, and the category
